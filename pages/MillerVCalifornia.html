			<h1>Miller V. California</h1>
			<hr>
			<h2>Case Overview</h2>
			<h3>In 1973, a publisher named Marvin Miller, also known as the King of Smut, was prosecuted for sending mass advertisements for four obscene books -Intercourse, Man-Woman, Sex Orgies Illustrated, and An Illustrated History of Pornography – and one film, titled Marital Intercourse. He was convicted under California law that prohibited the distribution of illicit material. This conviction was affirmed in a Californian court of appeals. Miller then appealed to the Supreme Court stating that it is his First Amendment right to express such materials and that the material in question was also not obscene.</h3>

			<h2>Constitutional Question</h2>

			<hr>
			<h2>Court Decision</h2>
			<h3>The Supreme Court affirmed Mr. Miller’s conviction by a vote of 5 to 4.</h3>
			<hr>
			<h2>Significance</h2>
			<h3>A three-part test has been implemented to see if the content is within California obscenity standards. The test is named the Miller Test. The California obscenity standards have been updated and are today’s current obscenity standards. I find the case was fairly settled.</h3>
